%% Non-Dominated sort. 
% The initialized population is sorted based on non-domination. The fast
% sort algorithm [1] is described as below for each

% • for each individual p in main population P do the following
%   – Initialize Sp = []. This set would contain all the individuals that is
%     being dominated by p.
%   – Initialize np = 0. This would be the number of individuals that domi-
%     nate p.
%   – for each individual q in P
%       * if p dominated q then
%           · add q to the set Sp i.e. Sp = Sp ? {q}
%       * else if q dominates p then
%           · increment the domination counter for p i.e. np = np + 1
%   – if np = 0 i.e. no individuals dominate p then p belongs to the first
%     front; Set rank of individual p to one i.e prank = 1. Update the first
%     front set by adding p to front one i.e F1 = F1 ? {p}
% • This is carried out for all the individuals in main population P.
% • Initialize the front counter to one. i = 1
% • following is carried out while the ith front is nonempty i.e. Fi != []
%   – Q = []. The set for storing the individuals for (i + 1)th front.
%   – for each individual p in front Fi
%       * for each individual q in Sp (Sp is the set of individuals
%         dominated by p)
%           · nq = nq?1, decrement the domination count for individual q.
%           · if nq = 0 then none of the individuals in the subsequent
%             fronts would dominate q. Hence set qrank = i + 1. Update
%             the set Q with individual q i.e. Q = Q ? q.
%   – Increment the front counter by one.
%   – Now the set Q is the next front and hence Fi = Q.
%
% This algorithm is better than the original NSGA ([2]) since it utilize
% the informatoion about the set that an individual dominate (Sp) and
% number of individuals that dominate the individual (np).
